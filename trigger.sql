-- Trigger

-- Just  theory, as functiob and sored procedures were made using GUI and also, no specific standard found. (Theory bis enough)

/* Triggers are automtically executed when an event occures. 
Eg- when we INSERT, SELECT or DELETE . We can tell the trigger do some work when a specific work 
such as backup the data that has been deleted.

We also use them for checking data after operations, handling errors etc.
